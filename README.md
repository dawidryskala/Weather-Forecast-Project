# Weather-Forecast-Project
## Weather forecast for a given place for 5 days with every 3 hour intervals and the local time of the place

**To be able to open my project you need to download all resources. Then you need to use terminal to get into this project and enter `npm i` (to install all required extenions ) and then `nodemon index.js` to start server. Go to `localhost:3000` and see my project :slightly_smiling_face:**

**When it comes to styling CSS is simple. I put the main emphasis on making the website dynamic. First, you need to enter a place. If it's in the database, you'll see the weather forecast for that place. Scrolling down you will see forecast for next hours.**
