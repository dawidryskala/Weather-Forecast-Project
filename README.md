# Weather-Forecast-Project
Weather forecast for a given place for 5 days with every 3 hour intervals and the local time of the place

To be able to open my project you need to download all resources.
Then you need to use terminal to get into this project and write `npm i` (to install all required extenions )
and then `nodemon index.js` to start server. Go to `localhost:3000` and see my project :slightly_smiling_face:
